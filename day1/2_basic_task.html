        <h1>웹의 동작 방식</h1>
        <p>
        How the web works provides a simplified view of what happens when you view a webpage in a web browser on your computer or phone.

        <h2>클라이언트와 서버</h2>
        Computers connected to the internet are called <strong>clients</strong> and <strong> servers</strong>.
        A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:
        <hr />
        <ul>
            <li>Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
            <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
